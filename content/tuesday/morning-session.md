Inlists, models, and photos are the core of MESA, and you can do a lot of great science without even knowing how to write a line of Fortran code. But fairly soon in your MESA journey, you will run into limits of what you can do with inlists alone. This is where `run_star_extras.f90` comes in. It allows you to extend MESA's capabilities by writing your own Fortran code that can interact with the star model. A few examples of things you can do with `run_star_extras.f90` include:

- creating a custom stopping condition
- changing control parameters during a run without restarting
- adding custom data to profile or history files
- implementing custom physics, like energy sources or mass loss prescriptions

The goal of these exercises is to get you up and running with `run_star_extras.f90` and provide a resource you can return to when you next need to extend MESA.

## About This Tutorial

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you

- have a working installation of MESA 24.08.1
- can do basic command line operations
- can open, edit, and save files in a text editor
- know basic MESA operations like editing inlists, looking up documentation, compiling, and running MESA projects

Before starting this tutorial, students had a short presentation. You can find the slides for that presentation [here](../Customizing-MESA-with-run_star_extras.f90.pdf) or the interactive Google Slides version which has more context in the presenter notes [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d7E1lgK4zW_xxCUbd4lgPkWA4UtUMAQhug6JaWQPTYY/edit?usp=sharing). However, one can complete this tutorial without having seen that presentation.

### Learning Objectives

In this tutorial you'll learn how toâ€¦

- set up a MESA project to use `run_star_extras.f90`
- understand the structure of `run_star_extras.f90` and how it fits into MESA's execution flow
- implement a custom stopping condition that couldn't be done with inlists alone
- implement new physics in MESA by writing some basic Fortran code
- [BONUS] add new columns to the profile and history files

You'll do this by reading through the provided material and completing clearly outlined **tasks**. Most tasks have hints and/or answers available if you get stuck. Don't be afraid to use these! Just click on the header for a hint or answer to expand it.

### About the Author

Hi, I'm [Bill Wolf](https://billwolf.space). I'm an associate professor of physics and astronomy at [the University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu), where I study the physics of accreting white dwarf stars with a team of undergraduate researchers. I've been using MESA since 2012 and have been a TA, organizer, or lecturer in 11 MESA schools since. I've been on the MESA Developer team since 2017, where my primary responsibiltiy is our [distributed testing infrastructure](https://testhub.mesastar.org). I also wrote a few tools to work with MESA, including [MESA Explorer](https://billwolf.space/mesa-explorer), [MESA Reader](https://billwolf.space/py_mesa_reader), and [MesaScript](https://billwolf.space/MesaScript/).

### Acknowledgements

This material is strongly influenced by similar material from past MESA schools by [Josiah Schwab](http://yoshiyahu.org), a former MESA developer. Specifically, this material is a light updating and reformatting of the later material in his [introductory materials for the 2021 MESA summer school](https://jschwab.github.io/mesa-2021/).

## Part 0: Fortran Basics

Fortran is a powerful language for scientific computing offering modern features with strong performance. However, one rarely writes in Fortran for their everyday tasks. With MESA, you'll rarely need to write much Fortran from scratch, but you will need to edit **functions** (which cannot change their inputs and must have a return value) and **subroutines** (which *can* change their inputs and have no return value). This section provides some basic Fortran syntax to get you started. If you are already familiar with Fortran, feel free to skip this section. If you are new, skim it and come back to it as needed.

### Variables

#### Declaring Variables

Fortran is a statically-typed language, meaning you must declare the type of each variable before using it. The type of a variable determines what kind of data it can hold and how much memory it uses. Variable declarations *must* come at the beginning of function and subroutine implementations. Here are some common types:

```fortran
! declare a boolean variable
logical :: flag

! declare an integer variable
integer :: i

! declare a double precision variable
real(dp) :: foo

! declare a 1d array with 10 elements
real(dp), dimension(10) :: bar
```

Note: to make a variable double precision, you must declare it with `real(dp)` rather than just `real`.

#### Assigning Variables

When dealing with numerical literals, Fortran uses the `d` suffix to indicate double precision. For example, `3.14` is single precision, while `3.14d0` is double precision. Here are some examples of assigning values to variables:

```fortran
! booleans have two special values
flag = .true.
flag = .false.

! arrays are 1-indexed (using parentheses)
bar(1) = 3.14d0
bar(2:9) = 0
bar(10) = 2.72d0
```

### Logic and Control Flow

#### Comparison Operators

There are two (equivalent) forms of comparison operators in Fortran

| text form | symbol form | description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `.gt.` | `>` | greater than |
| `.lt.` | `<` | less than |
| `.ge.` | `>=` | greater than or equal to |
| `.le.` | `<=` | less than or equal to |
| `.eq.` | `==` | equal to |
| `.ne.` | `/=` | not equal to |

```fortran
! these are the same
(i .ne. 0)
(i /= 0)
```

#### Logical Operators

There are three logical operators: `.and.`, `.or.`, and `.not.`.

```fortran
! true when 0 < i < 10
((i > 0) .and. (i < 10))

! true when i /= 0,1
(.not. ((i .eq. 0) .or. (i .eq. 1)))
```

#### If, Then, and Else

```fortran
! here is an example of how to do some logic
if (x .gt. 0) then
   heavyside = 1.0
else if (x .lt. 0) then
   heavyside = 0.0
else
   heavyside = 0.5
end if
```

#### Loops

```fortran
! here is an example of a do loop
array(1) = 1
array(2) = 1
do i = 3, 10
   array(i) = array(i-1) + array(i-2)
enddo
```

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Project
> [!WARNING]
>  These next two code blocks show how you **might** set up a MESA project, but don't actually execute them! In Task 1.1, you'll actually get your project set up.


When starting a new MESA project, you will often begin with the default work directory:

```bash
cp -r $MESA_DIR/star/work my_new_project
cd my_new_project
```
This would create a new directory called `my_new_project` with the default MESA work directory structure. You could then edit the inlist files to set up your model.

In other cases, you might start with an existing test case that is close to the science you are interested in. For instance, I study novae, so I might start with the `wd_nova_burst` test case:

```bash
cp -r $MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/wd_nova_burst my_new_project
cd my_new_project
```

For this tutorial, I am providing a work directory that is already set up for you. It's pretty simple; it evolves a 1.0 solar mass star from near the zero-age main sequence to core hydrogen exhaustion, and then pauses before exiting.

> [!NOTE]
>  This work directory is designed to run pretty quickly. For parts 1 through 3, no simulations should take more than about a minute to run. They may take a bit longer in part 4, but still should finish within a few minutes.


|ðŸ“‹ **Task 1.1**|
|:---|
|[Download the work directory](../day2-dev_mesa.zip), move it somewhere sensible, unzip it, and change into the directory.|

<details class="hx-border hx-border-green-200 dark:hx-border-green-200 hx-rounded-md hx-my-2">
<summary class="hx-bg-green-100 dark:hx-bg-neutral-800 hx-text-green-900 dark:hx-text-green-200 hx-p-2 hx-m-0 hx-cursor-pointer">
    <em>Click here for <strong>hints</strong> or <strong>answers</strong></em>
</summary>

<div class="hx-p-2">

After downloading the work directory linked in the task above, you can do everything else from the command line:

Move the directory to your desktop (or wherever you want to work on it):

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/day2-dev_mesa.zip ~/Desktop/
```
Unzip the directory:

```bash
unzip ~/Desktop/day2-dev_mesa.zip
```
Change into the directory:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/day2-dev
```

If you're computer is too smart, it may have automatically unzipped the directory for you. In that case, you can just move the directory and change into it:

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/day2-dev ~/Desktop/
cd ~/Desktop/day2-dev
```
</div>
</details>

Now let's make sure everything is working correctly.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 1.2**|
|:---|
|Compile and run the project.|

If things are set up properly, you should see a pgstar window open up, and the project should run for about 94 timesteps and pause before closing. If not, consult the hints and answer below, and reach out to tablemates or a TA for help if you can't get it working.

<em><strong>Answer</strong></em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-2">

To compile and run the project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
./mk && ./rn
```

Note that putting `&&` between two commands means that the second command will only run if the first command succeeds. If you want to run the commands separately, you can use `./mk` to compile and `./rn` to run the project.

</summary>
<div class="hx-p-2">

Are you in the correct directory? Execute `ls` to make sure you see the normal contents of a MESA work directory, including `inlist`, `mk`, and `rn`.

Is your MESA environment set up correctly? Ensure that executing `mesasdk_version` prints out the version of the MESA SDK you have installed, and similarly ensure that `echo $MESA_DIR` prints out the path to your MESA installation.

It's also possible that the executables (like `./mk` and `./rn`) are not executable as a side effect of downloading these files from the web. You can make them executable with the following command:

```bash
chmod +x mk rn clean re
```

</div>
</details>

## Part 2: Setting Up Your `run_star_extras.f90`
The file `run_star_extras.f90` lives in the `src` directory of your work directory. It is a Fortran file you can edit to add your own custom code that will run during the evolution of your stellar model. The file is already set up, but isn't very useful yet.

### Creating a boilerplate `run_star_extras.f90`

> [!NOTE]
> We'll be opening and editing files a lot for the rest of this tutorial. For simplicity, I'm assuming you're using VS Code and its associated `code` command to open and edit files. But if you're using, say, Emacs, you can substitute `code` with `emacs` (or whatever command you use to open files in your text editor of choice).

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 2.1**|
|:---|
| Open the file `run_star_extras.f90` in your favorite text editor.|
|You can change into the `src` directory and then open the file (e.g. `cd src && code run_star_extras.f90`, but remember to `cd ..` to return to the work directory when you are done with the `src` directory) or open it directly (e.g. `code src/run_star_extras.f90`)|

You should see a file that looks like this:

```fortran
! ***********************************************************************

      module run_star_extras

      use star_lib
      use star_def
      use const_def
      use math_lib
      
      implicit none
      
      ! these routines are called by the standard run_star check_model
      contains
      
      include 'standard_run_star_extras.inc'

      end module run_star_extras
      
```

This file defines a module called `run_star_extras`, which itself loads four other modules (`star_lib`, `star_def`, `const_def`, and `math_lib`), which refer to different parts of MESA's other modules that might be useful to you. The `implicit none` statement is a good practice in Fortran that prevents you from accidentally using variables that haven't been declared.

The actual "body" of the module is then delegated to the file `standard_run_star_extras.inc`, which is included at the end of the module. This file has the main boilerplate of most of the code you might want to edit, and it is by default set up to do nothing. To edit this text, though, we need to copy it into our `run_star_extras.f90`.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 2.2**|
|:---|
|Copy the *entire* contents of `$MESA_DIR/include/standard_run_star_extras.inc` and paste them into your `run_star_extras.f90` file, replacing the `include 'standard_run_star_extras.inc'` line.|
|Maintain the lines above and below the `include` line, as they are necessary for the module to work correctly.|

<em><strong>Hint</strong></em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-2">

There are fancy command line ways to do this, but for me, I prefer to actually do the copy and paste in a text editor. Open up the file with your favorite text editor. Perhaps with VS Code:

```bash
code $MESA_DIR/include/standard_run_star_extras.inc
```

Then select **all** the text in the file, copy it, and paste it into your `run_star_extras.f90` file. You can open that file in the same way:

```bash
code src/run_star_extras.f90
```

of if you are already in the `src` directory, you can just use:

```bash
code run_star_extras.f90
```

The newly-pasted content should start with the subroutine `extras_controls` and end with the subroutine `extras_after_evolve`, though the line `end module run_star_extras` should still be at the end of the file.

Below is the complete contents of what your edited `run_star_extras.f90` file should look like. If you ran into issues getting things copied properly, just copy the code below and paste it into your `run_star_extras.f90` file, replacing *everything* in that file.

### Baby's first Fortran and Fortran Errors

Now that we have a boilerplate `run_star_extras.f90` file, we can start modifying MESA's behavior with our own code. We should briefly review what all these functions and subroutines do, and then we can write our first Fortran code.

Perhaps you've seen the flowchart below (courtesy of Josiah Schwab) before. It shows the flow of control in MESA's evolution code, and how `run_star_extras.f90` fits into it. You might want to download this flowchart and use it to prototype where your own code will go.

<div class="hx-bg-white p-4 rounded">
  <embed src="../flowchart.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="600px" />
</div>

Each of the `extras_*` functions and subroutines in `run_star_extras.f90` is called at a different point in the evolution process. Need to set a variable at the beginning of a run? Use `extras_startup`. Need to check a condition at the end of each step? Use `extras_check_model`. We won't see examples of all of these today, but I encourage you to look at the `run_star_extras.f90` files in many of the MESA test cases to learn more about how they can be used.

`extras_check_model` is one of the more commonly used functions, as it is called at the end of each solver iteration. Let's use it to do the simplest thing we can: print a message to the terminal. This is a good first step to make sure we can compile and run our code without errors.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 2.4**|

|Once you confirm that the code works, you may cancel the run by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.|

</summary>
<div class="hx-p-4">

Yes, the "boilerplate" function is certainly not empty. It should look like this:

```fortran
integer function extras_check_model(id)
    integer, intent(in) :: id
    integer :: ierr
    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    ierr = 0
    call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
    if (ierr /= 0) return
    extras_check_model = keep_going
    if (.false. .and. s% star_mass_h1 < 0.35d0) then
        ! stop when star hydrogen mass drops to specified level
        extras_check_model = terminate
        write(*, *) 'have reached desired hydrogen mass'
        return
    end if


    ! if you want to check multiple conditions, it can be useful
    ! to set a different termination code depending on which
    ! condition was triggered.  MESA provides 9 customizable
    ! termination codes, named t_xtra1 .. t_xtra9.  You can
    ! customize the messages that will be printed upon exit by
    ! setting the corresponding termination_code_str value.
    ! termination_code_str(t_xtra1) = 'my termination condition'

    ! by default, indicate where (in the code) MESA terminated
    if (extras_check_model == terminate) s% termination_code = t_extras_check_model
end function extras_check_model
```

That's quite a mouthful! Everything down to and including `extras_check_model = keep_going` is boilerplate code that you should not change. It defines the type of the single input (an integer associated with the stellar model in question, called `id`), an error-tracking integer `ierr`, and the star info structure `s`, which is an enormous structure that contains all data about the stellar model (more on this later).

Below that, and up until the `if (extras_check_model == terminate)` line is an example stopping condition and explanation comments that you may delete if you wish. I'll explain what's going on there, though, as custom stopping conditions are a common use of `extras_check_model`.

The `if (.false. .and. s% star_mass_h1 < 0.35d0)` line is a placeholder for a condition that will never be true. If the `.false.` were instead `.true.`, this sets a custom stopping condition based on the star's hydrogen mass, which is a member of the `s` structure with a key of `star_mass_h1`. Assuming the stopping condition has been met, you can see a message being printed out, and the crucial line `extras_check_model = terminate`, which tells MESA to stop the evolution and exit. The line `s% termination_code = t_extras_check_model` sets a custom termination code that can be used to identify where the star model stopped; this is useful particularly in test cases to ensure that a model stopped for the reason we expect it to stop.

So where does your code go? I recommend putting it right after the `extras_check_model = keep_going` line, as this is where you can add your own custom code that will run at the end of each timestep.

Your final `extras_check_model` function should look like this (I've removed the bogus stopping condition and extra comments; see hint above for context):

```fortran
integer function extras_check_model(id)
    integer, intent(in) :: id
    integer :: ierr
    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    ierr = 0
    call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
    if (ierr /= 0) return
    extras_check_model = keep_going
    write(*,*) 'Hello, MESA!'
    
    if (extras_check_model == terminate) s% termination_code = t_extras_check_model
end function extras_check_model
```

Ensure that your function looks just like this, with the `write(*,*) 'Hello, MESA!'` line added after the `extras_check_model = keep_going` line. Then in the terminal, run the following commands to compile and run the project:

```bash
./mk && ./rn
```
You should see a bunch of messages printed to the terminal, including `Hello, MESA!` printed at the end of each timestep. If you see any errors, read them carefully, and if you can't figure out what went wrong, ask a TA or tablemate for help.

Your [broken] code should now look like this:

```fortran
integer function extras_check_model(id)
    integer, intent(in) :: id
    integer :: ierr
    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    ierr = 0

    write(*,*) 'Hello, MESA!
    
    if (extras_check_model == terminate) s% termination_code = t_extras_check_model
end function extras_check_model

When you run `./mk`, you should see an error message like this:

```

Error: Unterminated character constant beginning at (1)
make: *** [run_star_extras.o] Error 1

```
This indicates that the string beginning at the position marked by "1" (below the letter H) on line 100 (for me, at least) is unterminated, meaning that the compiler expected a closing quote but didn't find one. The compiler is pretty good at pointing out where the error is, but sometimes it can be a bit more cryptic than this helpful error. But don't ignore compiler errors! They are your friend, and they will help you find and fix bugs in your code.

You've now made some edits to the `run_star_extras.f90` file, compiled it, and run it successfully. You've even seen what an error looks like. Now let's get to doing something more interesting.

## Part 3: Adding a Custom Stopping Condition
If you assume the Earth is a perfect blackbody, its equilibrium temperature is given by

$$T_\oplus = T_\odot \left(\frac{R_\odot}{2\,\mathrm{AU}}\right)^{1/2}$$

Suppose the model we're been playing with is meant to model the sun, and we want to stop the evolution when the temperature at Earth rises above some critical value. The first step would be to search through `$MESA_DIR/star/controls.defaults` (or the equivalent page on the [online MESA documentation](https://docs.mesastar.org)) to see if such a stopping condition already exists. I can tell you right now, though, that it does not. We're going to have to add this condition ourselves.

Before we do that, though, we need to talk a bit about how the **star info structure** works.

### The Star Info Structure

Internally, all the information about your stellar model is stored in a single giant structure called the **star info structure**. This object has all the data about the star like its mass, luminosity, temperature profile, etc. It also contains all of the parameters you set in the inlists (whether you explicitly set them or not). Finally, it has pointers to functions it might use, like the very `extras_check_model` function we just edited (see how they are set in `extras_controls`).

Within most functions in `run_star_extras.f90`, you will see a line like this:

```fortran
type (star_info), pointer :: s
```
This declares a pointer to the star info structure, which we will use to access the data about the star. Simply declaring this variable doesn't set it up, though. We need to call the `star_ptr` subroutine to set it up. This is done in the boilerplate code at the beginning of each function, like so:

```fortran
ierr = 0
call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
if (ierr /= 0) return
```
The `star_ptr` subroutine takes the `id` of the star model (which is passed to the function) and sets the pointer `s` to point to the star info structure for that model. If there is an error, it sets `ierr` to a non-zero value, which we check for immediately after calling `star_ptr`. If there is an error, we return from the function early.
This is a common pattern in MESA code, and you'll see it in many of the functions in `run_star_extras.f90`. The star info structure is a powerful tool that allows you to access all the data about your star model, and it's essential to understand how to use it.

So what are all the "members" of the star info structure? Unfortunately, they're not as well documented as they could be, but here are a few guidelines for learning about different types of members.

- **Stellar Structure:** For quantities of interest for stellar structure, check `$MESA_DIR/star_data/public/star_data_step_work.inc` and `$MESA_DIR/star_data/public/star_data_step_input.inc`, though other files in the same folder may also contain useful members. **Unless otherwise specified in the comments, all members are in cgs units.** This is not usually the case for *inlist* values, which often use solar values.

- **Inlist Values:** All inlist controls are also members of the star info structure, so you can access (and change!) them in your `run_star_extras.f90` file. Whether the changes you make will take effect on the current timestep or the next one depends on the specific control and what function/subroutine you change it in within `run_star_extras.f90`.

One very useful family of inlist value members are the extra user-accessible inlist values, called `x_ctrl`, `x_integer_ctrl`, and `x_logical_ctrl`. These are all arrays that can be set in the inlist (e.g. `x_ctrl(1) = 3.14d0`) and are then made available in the star_info structure (e.g. `s% x_ctrl(1)`). This is a much better way to communicate data with your `run_star_extras.f90` file than modifying the code directly, necessitating frequent recompilation.

#### Accessing Members of the Star Info Structure

To access a member of the star info structure, you use the `%` operator. For example, to access an array of the star's mass at each zone, you'd use `s% m` (assuming `s` is the pointer to the star info structure). To access a single value, like the star's luminosity, you'd use `s% photosphere_L`. If you've used other programming languages, this is similar to accessing a property of an object in Python or JavaScript, or a field of a struct in C; we just use the `%` operator instead of a dot (`.`) or arrow (`->`) operator.

#### Aside: Solar vs. cgs Units

Internally, MESA is all in cgs units, but many inlist values (and some members of the star info structure) are in solar units out of convenience. Additionally, many user-specified values will be in solar units. So being able to convert between solar and cgs units is very useful. For calculations like these, use the `const` module. The file `$MESA_DIR/const/public/const_def.f90` defines many useful constants. So long as `const_def` module is included in your `run_star_extras.f90` file, you can access them from anywhere. **They are not part of the star info structure**, so you don't need to use the `s%` prefix to access them. For example, to get the solar luminosity in erg/s, you would use `Lsun`, which is defined in `const_def.f90`.

### Assembling the Pieces

Now that we know how to access the star info structure, we can add a custom stopping condition based on the temperature at Earth. The first question you should ask is: where should this condition go in `run_star_extras.f90`? Given what we saw in `extras_check_model`, it seems like a reasonable place to put it. Indeed, this is how many stopping conditions are implemented. However, if you look at the flowchart above, you'll see that there is another function that gets the final say after a timestep is completed: `extras_finish_step`. This is actually a more appropriate place to put this condition, as it is called after a timestep is completed *and* the model is considered good enough to continue evolving (rather than being retried).

Once you know *where* you'll put the code, you need to know *how* to calculate the temperature at Earth. The equilibrium temperature of the Earth is given by:

$$T_\oplus = T_\odot \left(\frac{R_\odot}{2\,\mathrm{AU}}\right)^{1/2},$$

where $T_\odot$ is the effective temperature of the star and $R_\odot$ is the photospheric radius of the star. We need to figure out how to access these values in the star info structure.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 3.1**|
|:---|
| Look in `$MESA_DIR/star_data/public/star_data_step_work.inc` and `$MESA_DIR/star_data/public/star_data_step_input.inc` and find the members of the star info structure that correspond to the effective temperature and photospheric radius of the star.|
|You might find a couple of promising candidates, so look at comments, and then check your answer below.|

They are `Teff` (in `star_data_step_input`) or `photosphere_black_body_T` (in `star_data_step_work`) and `photosphere_R` (in `star_data_step_work`). Notably, **`photosphere_R` is in solar units**, so we will need to convert it to centimeters before using it in our calculation. The effective temperature is already in cgs units, so we can use it directly.

I'll give an honorable mention for `photosphere_T` (in `star_data_step_work`), but then we might get into a tough conversation about the precise definition of the effective temperature. Since it's the *power* coming from the sun that matters, the thing called effective temperature is what we want to use.

There are a couple of other radii to look at (for instance, `s% r(1)` is the radius at the first zone, but this may not be the photosphere depending on how the outer boundary condition is set up). My guess is that it wouldn't matter too much if you used something similar, but these are exactly the sorts of questions you should ask when you're writing your own extensions to MESA!

If you're uncertain about the precise meaning of a member, your best bet now is to go spelunking through the MESA source code (`$MESA_DIR/star/private`) and look where the value is set or used. Usually using `grep` with `s% *MEMBER_NAME*` is a good place to start in finding these values in the wild. If you still can't find it, but you can at least trace some of your steps, showing this work in a message to the MESA Discussion forum will make it much more likely that others will help you pick up the trail!
</div>
</details>

Now that we have the star info structure members rounded up, there's another wrinkle: the radius will be in solar units while the temperature will be in cgs units, so we'll also need to convert AU and $R_\odot$ to cm. We could look these up and hardcode them, but MESA has a `const` module that contains *many* useful constants, and it's included and ready to use.

Unsurprisingly, the AU is just called `au` (or `AU`; Fortran is case-insensitive). You can find it on line 94 of `$MESA_DIR/const/public/const_def.f90`.

```fortran
real(dp), parameter :: au = 1.49597870700D13 ! (cm) - exact value defined by IAU 2009, 2012

### Putting It All Together
Now that we have all the pieces, we can put them together to create a custom stopping condition. We'll add this code to the `extras_finish_step` function, which is called after each timestep is completed.

    write(*,*) 'Earth equilibrium temperature:', T_eq_earth

    if (extras_finish_step == terminate) s% termination_code = t_extras_finish_step
end function extras_finish_step
```

The highlighted lines show the definition of the variable `T_eq_earth`, its assignment using the formula, constants, and star info structure members we discussed earlier, and the `write` statement that prints the equilibrium temperature of the Earth to the screen.

Assuming you've defined a variable for the equilibrium temperature of the Earth (let's call it `T_earth_eq`), you can check if it exceeds the value set in `s% x_ctrl(1)` like so:

```fortran

Now let's test our new stopping condition. We'll need to set the value of `x_ctrl(1)` in the inlist. We'll set it to a pretty high value of 310 K, but this is too high to reach in the current model since it stops at core hydrogen depletion.

> [!CAUTION]
> Note that within an inlist, the star info structure is nowhere to be found. **You should not use `s%` within an inlist, EVER.**. When *accessing inlist values in `run_star_extras.f90`*, you are querying the star info structure, so you *do* need to use `s%`. In short, you'll just use `x_ctrl(1)` in the inlist, but `s% x_ctrl(1)` in your Fortran code.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 3.5**|

<div class="hx-p-4">

Assuming your `run_star_extras.f90` file is set up correctly (see previous answer), your `inlist_project` should now have this section in it:

```fortran
! EARLIER PARTS OMITTED FOR BREVITY
&controls
    ! OTHER CONTROLS SETTINGS OMITTED FOR BREVITY

    ! when to stop
    ! stop when the center mass fraction of h1 drops below this limit
    ! xa_central_lower_limit_species(1) = 'h1'
    ! xa_central_lower_limit(1) = 1d-2

    ! stop when earth equilibrium temperature exceeds this limit
    x_ctrl(1) = 310
```

Note that the old stopping condition is commented out. You could also just delete it. Note also that we don't need to specify units for `x_ctrl(1)` (nor could we).
</div>
</details>

When the run terminates, you should see the message you included in the `extras_finish_step` function printed to the terminal, indicating that the temperature at Earth exceeded the value set in `x_ctrl(1)`. If so, congratulations! You've successfully added a custom stopping condition to MESA.

## Part 4: Adding Extra Physics

The stopping condition we just added is a simple one, and it doesn't actually affect how the star evolves. It just tells MESA when to stop. However, we can also make dynamic changes to our model at various points in the evolution. A simple way is by changing inlist controls on the fly. For instance, we could decrease the resolution once total burning from carbon fusion exceeds some value.

### Steps for Implementing a Hook

More interesting is adding new physics to the model. This is a bit more involved, but for the most part, this can be done in `run_star_extras.f90`, rather than hacking at MESA itself. We do this through so-called "hooks," which are functions that MESA calls at specific points within the monolithic "take step" stage on the flowchart above. There are many of these hooks, so they are not included in the standard `run_star_extras.f90` boilerplate. 

Instead, we follow a multi-step process to implement a new hook:

1. Copy and paste the boilerplate code for your hook from the appropriate file in `$MESA_DIR/star/other`.
2. Rename the subroutine/function to something more meaningful.
3. In `extras_controls`, add a line to set the pointer to your new hook subroutine/function.
4. Turn on the hook in your inlist by setting the appropriate control to `.true.`.
5. Actually implement the hook inside the currently empty subroutine/function, compile, debug, and run.

That sounds like a lot, but most of the work is just in step 5 where you actually implement the physics. The rest is just boilerplate or reading simple instructions in the template files.

As a toy model, we'll use the `other_energy` hook to add some mysterious new energy source to our solar model, following all the steps in this process.

### Step 1: Copy the Boilerplate

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 4.1**|
|:---|
|In your terminal, navigate to `$MESA_DIR/star/other`. Execute `ls` and peruse the various hooks available to you.|
|Then, open `other_energy.f90` and copy *just* the subroutine `default_other_energy` into your `run_star_extras.f90` file.|

<em><strong>Hint:</strong> What all am I copying?</em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-4">

Within `$MESA_DIR/star/other/other_energy.f90`, copy all of this:

    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    integer :: k
    ierr = 0
    call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
    if (ierr /= 0) return
    !s% extra_heat(:) = s% extra_power_source
    ! note that extra_heat is type(auto_diff_real_star_order1) so includes partials.

<em><strong>Hint:</strong> Where should I paste this?</em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-4">

So long as the pasted subroutine is not inside another subroutine or function, it can go basically anywhere in `run_star_extras.f90` below the `contains` keyword. I recommend putting it either just after the last function/subroutine (but before the `end module run_star_extras` line) or just after the `extras_controls` subroutine. This way, it will be easy to find later.
</div>
</details>

At this point, it's a good idea change back into your work directory and try to recompile (`./mk`) to make sure you haven't introduced any syntax errors in `run_star_extras.f90`. If you have, fix them before proceeding.

### Step 2: Rename the Subroutine

Now that we have the boilerplate code, we need to rename the subroutine to something more meaningful. We'll call it `day2_other_energy`. Before we make changes, let's take a closer look at the boilerplate code we just copied:

```fortran
subroutine default_other_energy(id, ierr)
    use star_def
    use auto_diff
    use const_def, only: Rsun
    integer, intent(in) :: id
    integer, intent(out) :: ierr
    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    integer :: k
    ierr = 0
    call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
    if (ierr /= 0) return
    !s% extra_heat(:) = s% extra_power_source
    ! note that extra_heat is type(auto_diff_real_star_order1) so includes partials.
end subroutine default_other_energy
```

We see that it brings in a few other modules and defines some variables. There's also an interesting commented out bit of code that is leftover from older versions of MESA. It does show a nifty Fortran trick, though; you can use the `(:)` syntax to refer to all elements of an array, so `s% extra_heat(:)` refers to all elements of the `extra_heat` array in the star info structure.

We won't be doing that here, though, as we'll want to set the value of `extra_heat` to a different value at every zone in the model, so we can safely delete that line as well as the comment afterward.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 4.2**|
|:---|
|Rename the subroutine to `day2_other_energy` and delete the two comments at the end of the subroutine. Remember, the name appears at the beginning *and* the end of the subroutine!|
|Compile again to make sure you haven't introduced any syntax errors. If you have, fix them before proceeding.|

<div class="hx-p-4">

The renamed subroutine should look like this:

If you then read the `README` file in `$MESA_DIR/star/other`, you'll see that there are some instructions similar to these. Right now, we're dealing with step 2 in that file, which happens to use `other_energy` as an example!

<div class="hx-p-4">

You need to edit `extras_controls` by adding the following line somewhere in the giant block of pointer statements:

```fortran
s% other_energy => day2_other_energy
```

This sets the pointer `s% other_energy` to point to our new subroutine `day2_other_energy`. This is how MESA knows to call our subroutine when it reaches the `other_energy` hook in the flowchart. For me, the entirety of the `extras_controls` subroutine now looks like this:

```fortran {hl_lines=[32]}
subroutine extras_controls(id, ierr)
   integer, intent(in) :: id
   integer, intent(out) :: ierr
   type (star_info), pointer :: s
   ierr = 0
   call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
   if (ierr /= 0) return
   
   ! this is the place to set any procedure pointers you want to change
   ! e.g., other_wind, other_mixing, other_energy  (see star_data.inc)


   ! the extras functions in this file will not be called
   ! unless you set their function pointers as done below.
   ! otherwise we use a null_ version which does nothing (except warn).

   s% extras_startup => extras_startup
   s% extras_start_step => extras_start_step
   s% extras_check_model => extras_check_model
   s% extras_finish_step => extras_finish_step
   s% extras_after_evolve => extras_after_evolve
   s% how_many_extra_history_columns => how_many_extra_history_columns
   s% data_for_extra_history_columns => data_for_extra_history_columns
   s% how_many_extra_profile_columns => how_many_extra_profile_columns
   s% data_for_extra_profile_columns => data_for_extra_profile_columns  

   s% how_many_extra_history_header_items => how_many_extra_history_header_items
   s% data_for_extra_history_header_items => data_for_extra_history_header_items
   s% how_many_extra_profile_header_items => how_many_extra_profile_header_items
   s% data_for_extra_profile_header_items => data_for_extra_profile_header_items

   s% other_energy => day2_other_energy
end subroutine extras_controls
```
The highlighted line at the end is the only new addition.

### Step 4: Turn the Hook On

You're probably getting the hang of this by now, so I'll let you try this one on your own again.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 4.4**|
|:---|
|Return to the README and comments of the previous task and add a line to `inlist_project` that will turn on the `other_energy` hook.|
|To test to see if it's working, put a statement like `write(*,*) 'other_energy hook called'` in your `day2_other_energy` subroutine.|
|Compile and run the project again, and you should see this message printed to the terminal at every timestep.|

<details class="hx-border hx-border-green-200 dark:hx-border-green-200 hx-rounded-md hx-my-2">

<em><strong>Answer</strong></em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-4">

The line you need to add to your `inlist_project` file is:

```fortran
use_other_energy = .true.
```
This should go in the `controls` namelist, and it will turn on the `other_energy` hook.

Your `day2_other_energy` subroutine should now look like this:
```fortran {hl_lines=[4]}
subroutine day2_other_energy(id, ierr)
    ! BEGINNING OF SUBROUTINE OMITTED FOR BREVITY
    if (ierr /= 0) return
    write(*,*) 'other_energy hook called'
end subroutine day2_other_energy
```

When you compile and run the project, you should see the message `other_energy hook called` printed to the terminal at every timestep, indicating that your hook is being called correctly.

</div>
</details>

### Step 5: Implement the Hook

So far, we have a hook that is called, but does nothing. Now let's actually add the new energy source to the model. The way `other_energy` works is by changing the `extra_heat` array in the star info structure. This array is set to values of specific energy generation in erg/g/s at each zone in the model. The `extra_heat` array is of type `auto_diff_real_star_order1`, which means it can be used in the auto-differentiation framework that MESA uses to compute derivatives of the energy generation rate with respect to various parameters. We're not going to delve into why that's important, but that's why the `auto_diff` module is used in the boilerplate code we copied earlier, and it's also why this will differ a bit from similar subroutines from older releases of MESA.

First off, let's do nothing again, but in a fancier way.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 4.5**|
|:---|
|In your `day2_other_energy` subroutine, delete the `write(*,*)` statement we included earlier, and set the `extra_heat` array to a constant value of 0 by looping over all zones in the model. Fortran is 1-indexed, so your loop should start at 1 and go to `s% nz` (the number of zones in the model).|
|Note: you *could* use the nifty `(:)` syntax, but the point of this is to get a loop working that we can do more interesting things with later, so use a `do` loop instead.|
|Compile and run the project again, and you should see no change in the model evolution, but you should see no errors either.|

<details class="hx-border hx-border-green-200 dark:hx-border-green-200 hx-rounded-md hx-my-2">
<summary class="hx-bg-green-100 dark:hx-bg-neutral-800 hx-text-green-900 dark:hx-text-green-200 hx-py-2 hx-px-4 hx-m-0 hx-cursor-pointer">
<em><strong>Answer</strong></em>
</summary>
<div class="hx-p-4">

The `day2_other_energy` subroutine should now look like this:

```fortran {hl_lines=[13,14,15,16]}
subroutine day2_other_energy(id, ierr)
    use star_def
    use auto_diff
    use const_def, only: Rsun
    integer, intent(in) :: id
    integer, intent(out) :: ierr
    type (star_info), pointer :: s
    integer :: k
    ierr = 0
    call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
    if (ierr /= 0) return

    ! Set extra_heat to 0 at all zones
    do k = 1, s% nz
        s% extra_heat(k) = 0d0
    end do

end subroutine day2_other_energy
```

When you compile and run the project again, you should see no change in the model evolution, but you should also see no errors. The model should evolve as it did before, but now we have a hook that is doing something (even if it's just setting the `extra_heat` array to zero).

</div>
</details>

Now let's finally implement something that's actually interesting! We'll assume this magic new energy is distributed exponentially from the center as a function of the mass coordinate. That is, it's strongest at the center and decreases exponentially outward. We'll use this function:

$$\epsilon_{\mathrm{extra}}(M_r) = L_{\mathrm{extra}}\frac{1}{\Delta M}\exp\left(-\frac{M_r}{\Delta M}\right),$$

where $L_{\mathrm{extra}}$ is the total luminosity from this new energy source, $M_r$ is the mass coordinate of the zone, and $\Delta M$ is a characteristic mass scale that determines how quickly the energy source decreases with increasing mass coordinate. Well-behaved values for $\Delta M$ and $L_{\mathrm{extra}}$ are $0.05~M_\odot$ and $0.1~L_\odot$, respectively, but I encourage you to make these values user-accessible in the inlist so you can experiment with them later.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 4.6**|
|:---|
|Implement the above energy source in your `day2_other_energy` subroutine. You should already have a loop ready to go, but now instead of setting each zone's `extra_heat` to zero, you should compute the value locally for each zone.|
|As always, beware unit trickery!|
|Compile, run, and check the plot that shows `extra_energy` to confirm that it is behaving appropriately.|

While it may take more timesteps than before, the actual evolutionary time of the model should be lower, since the added energy source will cause Earth to heat up more quickly.

Okay, it's not "trickery" per se, but `s% extra_heat` is in erg/g/s, and we tend to think of masses and luminosities in solar units. My recommendation is to not fight your instincts and just convert everything to cgs within the subroutine. So if you read in $\Delta M$ and $L_{\mathrm{extra}}$ in solar units, convert them to cgs units using `Lsun` and `Msun` (from the `const` module) before using them in the calculation.

## Part 5: Bonus Exercise: Adding Custom Output Columns

If you got this far, you've done a great job! As a bonus exercise, let's compare the extra heating to the nuclear energy generation rate in the star, both locally and globally.

|ðŸ“‹ **Task 5.1**|
|:---|
|Use the existing four functions and subroutines dealing with history and profile columns to add a new column to both history and profile outputs. The history column should be called `L_ratio`, and it should be the ratio of the total extra heating to the total nuclear power generation in the star. The profile column should be called `eps_ratio`, and it should be the ratio of the local extra heating to the local specific nuclear energy generation rate.|
|When you have it working, load the last profile and history files in [MESA Explorer](https://billwolf.space/mesa-explorer/) and plot these new columns against model number (history) and mass coordinate (profile). You'll probably want to use a logarithmic scale for the y-axis of the profile plot.|

<em><strong>Hint:</strong> star info structure members</em>

<div class="hx-p-4">

You'll want to use the following member of the star info structure:
- `total_extra_heating`
- `total_nuclear_heating`
- `extra_heat`
- `eps_nuc`

Beware; `extra_heat` is of type `auto_diff_real_star_order1`, so you'll need to use the `val` member (`extra_heat(k)% val`) to get the actual value of the extra heating at each zone. `auto_diff` is a great tool, but sometimes these gotchas can trip you up if you're not careful (I wasn't at first!).

<em><strong>Answer</strong></em>

<div class="hx-p-4">

The four functions and subroutines you need to implement are:
```fortran {hl_lines=[8, 25, 26, 38, 57, 58, 59, 60]}
integer function how_many_extra_history_columns(id)
   integer, intent(in) :: id
   integer :: ierr
   type (star_info), pointer :: s
   ierr = 0
   call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
   if (ierr /= 0) return
   how_many_extra_history_columns = 1
end function how_many_extra_history_columns


subroutine data_for_extra_history_columns(id, n, names, vals, ierr)
   integer, intent(in) :: id, n
   character (len=maxlen_history_column_name) :: names(n)
   real(dp) :: vals(n)
   integer, intent(out) :: ierr
   type (star_info), pointer :: s
   ierr = 0
   call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
   if (ierr /= 0) return
   
   ! note: do NOT add the extras names to history_columns.list
   ! the history_columns.list is only for the built-in history column options.
   ! it must not include the new column names you are adding here.
   names(1) = 'L_ratio'
   vals(1) = s% total_extra_heating / (s% total_nuclear_heating)

end subroutine data_for_extra_history_columns


integer function how_many_extra_profile_columns(id)
   integer, intent(in) :: id
   integer :: ierr
   type (star_info), pointer :: s
   ierr = 0
   call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
   if (ierr /= 0) return
   how_many_extra_profile_columns = 1
end function how_many_extra_profile_columns


subroutine data_for_extra_profile_columns(id, n, nz, names, vals, ierr)
   integer, intent(in) :: id, n, nz
   character (len=maxlen_profile_column_name) :: names(n)
   real(dp) :: vals(nz,n)
   integer, intent(out) :: ierr
   type (star_info), pointer :: s
   integer :: k
   ierr = 0
   call star_ptr(id, s, ierr)
   if (ierr /= 0) return
   
   ! note: do NOT add the extra names to profile_columns.list
   ! the profile_columns.list is only for the built-in profile column options.
   ! it must not include the new column names you are adding here.

   names(1) = 'eps_ratio'
   do k = 1, nz
      vals(k,1) = s% extra_heat(k)% val / s% eps_nuc(k)
   end do
   
end subroutine data_for_extra_profile_columns
```
Note that most of this was boilerplate. We needed to set two integers (in the `how_many_extra_*` functions) to 1 instead of 0, and then we needed to set the names and values in the `data_for_extra_*` subroutines. For the profile case, we had to do a loop to set the value of the ratio for each zone, and since `extra_heat` is of type `auto_diff_real_star_order1`, we had to use the `val` member to get the actual value of the extra heating at each zone.

After re-running the model and uploading the output to MESA Explorer, here's what we get. First, the history plot of the ratio of total extra heating to total nuclear heating:
![History Plot of L_ratio](../ratio_history.svg)
And then the profile plot of the ratio of local extra heating to local nuclear energy generation:
![Profile Plot of eps_ratio](../ratio_profile.svg)
You can see that this blows up at the outer edge of the star, presumably because the nuclear energy generate rate drops off much faster than the extra heating exponential decay, causing the ratio to diverge.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations! Though these examples were relatively simple, these building blocks are the same one used to implement more complex physics in MESA. I do want to mention a few more things before we wrap up.

- **Additional Output (see bonus exercise):** If you want to output additional data to the history or profile files, you can do so by implementing the `how_many_extra_history_columns`, `data_for_extra_history_columns`, `how_many_extra_profile_columns`, and `data_for_extra_profile_columns` functions. These functions are called at the end of each timestep and allow you to add custom data to the output files. Note that you have to set the number of new columns in one function, and then that number is used in the other function to size the arrays that need to be set. You do **not** need to add these column names to `history_columns.list` or `profile_columns.list`.
- **Calling Functions:** Take a look in `$MESA_DIR/star/public/star_lib.f90`. This file exposes a bunch of functions that you can call from your `run_star_extras.f90` file if `star_lib` is imported with a `use` statement. For instance, you can call `star_relax_mass` to change the mass of a star dynamically right in the middle of a run without having to switch to a new inlist.
- **Saving Local Variables:** You can declare module-level variables (available across functions and subroutines) in `run_star_extras.f90`, but be careful with this, because they are not automatically saved when a photo is saved. You can add this feature by using the `other_photo_read` and `other_photo_write` hooks. These are [currently] not well documented, but see the `run_star_extras.f90` file of the `$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite/c13_pocket` test case to see how module level variables can be declared, used, and stored in photos using these hooks.
- **More Hooks and Examples:** In the spirit of the last point, you saw that there are *many* hooks available in MESA. Each one works a bit differently, and their documentation is not always clear. A good way to learn how to use them is to look at the test cases in `$MESA_DIR/star/test_suite`. Not every hook is tested, but many are, so you can see how they are used in practice. For a real tour de force of what you can do with `run_star_extras.f90`, check out the `ppisn` test case.

Have fun exploring what you can do with MESA! And when you really do get stuck, you can always send an email to the MESA users mailing list to see if a new pair of eyes can help you out. Just be sure to include a description of what you're trying to do, what you've tried, and any relevant code files. The MESA community is generally very helpful and responsive.
