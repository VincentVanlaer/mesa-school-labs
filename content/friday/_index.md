# Asteroseismology in MESA

In this series of labs, we will familiarise ourselves with `GYRE` --- a tool for computing the normal-mode frequencies of spherical stars. This series of labs is mainly intended to teach you how to do asteroseismology using `MESA` —  not asteroseismology itself — but we have also prepared a brief primer on asteroseismology [here](img/index.pdf).

Slides for the Friday labs can be found [here](slides).
