## Introduction
Over the past decade, it has become clear that most massive stars are born in binary or multiple-star systems. Throughout their evolution, these stars undergo various interactions that can significantly alter their properties. One such interaction is **mass transfer**, where stars exchange mass and angular momentum. Mass transfer plays a crucial role in producing various stellar phenomena, such as different types of core-collapse supernovae, magnetic stars, X-ray sources, and gravitational wave sources. The nature of these phenomena depends on **when the mass transfer occurs** and whether it is **stable or unstable**. In this lab, we will explore mass transfer across the initial binary parameter space.

> [!NOTE]
> In this lab, we only evolve the primary star (the initially more massive star) in detail, assuming the secondary star (the initially less massive star) as a point mass to reduce computation time. This is done via `evolve_both_stars = .false.` in `binary_job`, which is the default setting.  

## Task 1. Identifying different mass transfer cases
Mass transfer can be divided into three cases based on the evolutionary phase of the primary star when the transfer occurs. The primary star evolves faster, fills its Roche lobe, and begins transferring mass to the secondary star. The three cases are:  
Case A: The primary transfers mass while core hydrogen burning.  
Case B: The primary transfers mass while core helium burning.  
Case C: The primary transfers mass after the end of core helium burning.

Now, let's download the MESA work directory from [here](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/e438b0ef7cb64b90a497/?dl=1).

> [!TIP]
> To extract the compressed directory (`BinaryEvolution_Lab1.tar`) into the current folder, use the following command:
> ```
> tar -xf BinaryEvolution_Lab1.tar
> ```
> Once extracted, navigate into the directory with:
> ```
> cd BinaryEvolution_Lab1
> ```
> Now you are in the MESA work directory for this lab.

`inlist_extra` contains handles for `binary_controls` for changing initial binary parameters. What are the current initial primary mass, initial secondary mass, and initial orbital period?
{{< details title="Solution 0" closed="true" >}}
Initial primary mass: 20 Msun
Initial secondary mass: 12 Msun
Initial orbital period: 100 days
{{< /details >}}

**In Task 1, our goal is to determine during which evolutionary phase the primary star undergoes mass transfer. To this end, we will make step-by-step modifications to `src/run_binary_extras.f90`.** 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In `run_binary_extras.f90`, you can use the quantities internally computed by MESA using the binary pointer `b%` and star pointers `s1%`/`s2%` to access the primary/secondary modules, respectively. In this lab, you will be using the following parameters:
>
>- `b% s1% center_h1`: Hydrogen mass fraction at the center of the primary  
>- `b% s1% center_he4`: Helium mass fraction at the center of the primary  
>- `b% mtransfer_rate`: Mass transfer rate in g/s (negative)
> 
> We will use these parameters in the `extras_binary_finish_step` hook in `run_binary_extras.f90`

### Task 1-1. Is the primary undergoing mass transfer?
**As a first step, within the !!! TASK 1 block !!! of `run_binary_extras.f90`, add an if condition to check whether the primary star is undergoing mass transfer. A good threshold to determine this is a mass transfer rate greater than $10^{-10}$ Msun/yr. If this condition is met, make MESA print "Undergoing mass transfer".**

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to do `./clean` and `./mk` after modifying the `run_star_extras.f90` file.

{{< details title="Hint 1-1 (1)" closed="true" >}}
Check how to make MESA print a message in the terminal in the `!!! HINT block !!!` in `run_star_extras.f90`. It is: 
```
write(*,*) ' ... '
```
{{< /details >}}

{{< details title="Hint 1-1 (2)" closed="true" >}}
It is important to check the units of the parameters in MESA. In many cases, it is in cgs units. For example, mass transfer rate, ```b% mtransfer_rate```, is in g/s. Use the constants secyer (seconds in a year) and Msun (solar mass in grams) to convert g/s into Msun/yr. (You can use these in ```run_binary_extras.f90``` thanks to `use const_def`).
{{< /details >}}


{{< details title="Hint 1-1 (3)" closed="true" >}}
Convert mass transfer rate from g/s to Msun/yr  
1 year = 3.15576e7 s, 1 Msun = 1.989e33 g  
abs(b% mtransfer_rate)/Msun*secyer
{{< /details >}}

         !!! TASK 1 block begins !!!
         if (abs(b% mtransfer_rate)/Msun*secyer > 1d-10) then
             write(*,*) '****************** Undergoing mass transfer ******************'
         end if
         !!! TASK 1 block ends !!!
```

> [!TIP]
> When you do a MESA run via "./rn | tee out.txt", the terminal output is saved to a file called `out.txt`.
> So, even when you miss the terminal output in real-time, you can review the full output later by checking `out.txt`.
> If you're looking for specific content, you can search within the file using:
> ```grep -ir XXX out.txt```
> This command will help you find whether XXX appears anywhere in `out.txt`.

Please make sure that your implementation is working correctly by running a model and verifying that it produces the desired output when the mass-transfer rate exceeds the threshold. In the PGSTAR plot, you can find the mass-transfer rate in the upper right corner (`lg_mtransfer_rate`: mass transfer rate in Msun/yr in logarithmic scale). This run should end with the following terminal output:
```
 *********************************************
 **** Terminated at core carbon depletion ****
 *********************************************
```

### Task 1-2. Which evolutionary phase is the primary in?
As a next step, we want to determine the current evolutionary phase of the primary star. Typically, core hydrogen burning is considered complete when the central hydrogen abundance drops below 1e-6, and core helium burning ends when the central helium abundance drops below 1e-6. **Now, add conditions to !!! TASK 1 block !!! to identify which evolutionary state the primary star is in from the following list, and print it out:**  
1. Core hydrogen burning  
2. Core helium burning  
3. Past core helium burning  
Run the model and verify that the terminal output aligns with the results shown in the PGSTAR plot (upper middle panel)

> Don't forget to do `./clean` and `./mk` after modifying the `run_star_extras.f90` file.

{{< details title="Hint 1-2" closed="true" >}}
Use the mass fractions of hydrogen (```b% s1% center_h1```) and helium (```b% s1% center_he4```) to determine the current evolutionary phase. The conditions should involve checking whether the hydrogen/helium mass fractions are above or below 1e-6. Check how core carbon depletion is captured in the `!!! HINT block !!!` in `run_star_extras.f90`.

         end if
         
         if (b% s1% center_h1 > 1e-6) then

         end if
         !!! TASK 1 block ends !!!
```
{{< /details >}}

### Task 1-3. Print out Case A / B / C
As a last step, we want to print out in the terminal which mass transfer case is occurring whenever mass transfer takes place. **Comment out the previous code in the !!! TASK 1 block !!! and implement new if-else statements that print “Case A,” “Case B,” or “Case C” depending on the evolutionary phase of the primary.** After making changes, run your model. Can you determine which mass transfer case your model undergoes? If you miss the terminal output during the run, you can review the `out.txt` file to see the printed messages.

> [!WARNING]
> Don't forget to do `./clean` and `./mk` after modifying the `run_star_extras.f90` file.

**Bonus exercise:**  
Can you print out which mass transfer cases a binary system undergoes throughout its evolution at the end of the run? Try to capture all the cases. For example, Case A mass transfer is generally followed by Case B mass transfer. In this case, we want to print out "Case A + B" at termination.

## Task 2. Determine mass transfer stability
In some cases, mass transfer becomes unstable, leading the binary to enter a common-envelope phase. Run a binary model with an initial primary mass of 20 Msun, an initial secondary mass of 6 Msun, and an initial orbital period of 5 days by modifying `inlist_extra`. What do you see in the screen output and in the PGSTAR plot? Can you identify which parameter is changing significantly?  
Stop the run manually by `Ctrl+C` when the model number reaches ~150.

One way to detect this instability is to check the mass transfer rate and the timestep. If the mass transfer rate is high and the timestep becomes very small (on the order of seconds to minutes), it is an indication that unstable mass transfer has started.

**Write a code to terminate the run when the mass transfer rate exceeds $10^{-3}$ Msun/yr and the timestep falls below 0.1 years to capture an unstable mass transfer event, and make MESA print "Terminated due to unstable mass transfer" in the terminal.** Use `b% mtransfer_rate` (mass transfer rate in g/s, negative) and `b% s1% dt` (timestep in seconds) in `!!! TASK 2 block begins !!!`. If the mass transfer was stable or there was no mass transfer, the run will end with the printout "Terminated due to core carbon depletion" in the terminal (which is already implemented in the `!!! HINT block !!!`).  

If it took too long to reach this point (over ~20 mins), you can get the solution and proceed to Task 3.

## Task 3. Run a model with random initial binary parameters
Now, we will explore different mass transfer cases and their stability across the initial binary parameter space. We will fix an initial primary mass to 20 Msun. Choose a random pair of initial mass ratio and an initial orbital period from the "P-q diagram" sheet in the following Google Spreadsheet, and put your name in the corresponding column:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HLwsGPu6w3t2NMUcdVYvkHFvqgIOUDkigfrZruN6Uo8/edit?usp=sharing  
**And perform MESA run with the corresponding initial parameters.** If you have many cores (more than approx. 6), you can choose the ones with high initial orbital periods (>2000 days). You need to modify "inlist_extra" to use new initial binary parameters.

> [!TIP]
> You can check the number of cores via:  
> grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo       (in terminal for Linux)  
> echo %NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS%            (in CMD for Windows)  
> sysctl hw.ncpu                         (in terminal for macOS)  


Observe the terminal output to check the case of the mass transfer when mass transfer begins (this is because Case A is always followed by Case B). If you missed it, you can do 
```
grep -ir Case out.txt
```
to print out the occurrences of the string "Case" from the `out.txt` file. Record your results in the "P-q diagram" sheet in the Google Spreadsheet.

Parameters to Enter:  
**Initial mass ratio (M2/M1)**: A value between 0.1 and 0.9.  
**Initial orbital period**: A value between 1 and 3000 days.  
**Case**: One of A, B, or C.  
**Stable**: Enter y for stable mass transfer or n if terminated due to unstable mass transfer.  
If there was no mass transfer, leave **Case** and **Stable** blank.  


***
**Bonus exercise:**  
Here, you are asked to run one model.
If you complete this task quickly, feel free to select additional initial binary parameter pairs and run more models.
You may also choose an initial mass ratio and an initial orbital period different from those provided in the sheet.
(If you do so, please append your values as a new row at the end of the table.)
***

As many students input values, a pattern will emerge in the initial orbital period-mass ratio (P-q) diagram. 
- Where do Case A, B, and C systems appear on the P–q diagram, and why?
- How does the initial mass ratio influence the stability of mass transfer, and why?
- Do you observe any other interesting patterns? What might be the reasons behind them?
Discuss these questions with your group members.


# Task 4 (optional): Visualizing the effect of binary evolution with TULIPS
![Example TULIPS visualization](https://astro-tulips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/first_animation.gif "TULIPS visualization of the apparent size and color evolution of a massive star")

We can look at the outcome of binary evolution in more detail by visualizing our simulation results with [TULIPS](https://astro-tulips.readthedocs.io/), a Python package for stellar evolution visualization. We will create movies of the changes in the properties of a donor and accretor in a binary system pre-computed with MESA. For this exercise, you will need to upload the contents of the `LOGS1` and `LOGS2` output directories found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n_KliN8Jfmy0VXGFLE2o57U5_cy_oj0N?usp=sharing) into this [Google Collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tkEXYIyOM7sWmnKZu4Ds1I235lnZHD7i?usp=sharing).
