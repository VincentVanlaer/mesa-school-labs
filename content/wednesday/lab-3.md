## Wednesday Mini-lab 3: Upsilon Sagittarii 
Upsilon Sagittarii is a hydrogren deficient binary that has been suggested to be in its second stage of mass transfer, after the primary has expanded to become a helium supergiant following core helium exhaustion. [Gilkis & Tomer 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.3541G/abstract) have identified the progentitor of this system to be a 5 solar mass star with a 3.125 solar mass companion and an initial orbital period of 8.4 days. In this lab, we will use the observed parameters of the binary system to stop the MESA runs at the approrpiate time.

The stellar parameters can be found in this table, which has been adapted from Table 1 of [Gilkis & Tomer 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.518.3541G/abstract).
| Parameter       | Value       |
| -----------     | ----------- |
| $T_{eff,1}[kK]$      | $10\pm1$       |
| $T_{eff,2}[kK]$      | $23\pm2$        |
| $logL_{1}[Lsun]$    | $3.67\pm0.15$       |
| $logL_{2}[Lsun]$    | $3.1\pm0.2$        |
| $R_{1}[Rsun]$       | $28\pm8$       |
| $R_{2}[Rsun]$       | $2.2\pm0.3$        |
| $logg_{1}[cm/s^{2}]$   | $1.0$            |
